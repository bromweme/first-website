            Hello! My name is Michael. I'm 27 years old and I'm a software engineer from Cincinnati, OH.
            I've only recently gotten into programming and even more recently have got into web development.
            So far I'm having a great time learning how to manipulate HTML with CSS. 
             In my free time I hang out 
            with friends, go to the gym, and go on a trail or to the park with my dog. My dog's name is Ellie, she's a seven year old chow mix and she's my best friend.

        <p id= "para-education">
            I attend Cincinnati State and am projected to get a degree in Software Engineering Technologies
            in the Spring of 2022. In my free time I wanted to learn how to make a website, so I am going through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>
            to learn about web development.
        <h3>Here are a list of the programming languages that I have learned.</h3>

            All of my projects are uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>! The current projects I am working on are a <a href="#" target="_blank">website</a> (this one) 
            and a <a href="#">fitness app</a>.
