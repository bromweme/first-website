Hello! This is my first website I've ever created. I've used theodinproject.com to set up git/github, and www.freecodecamp.org to learn HTML and CSS. 

The website is super basic, but will eventually serve as a sort of resume down the road when I apply to jobs relating to programming. 

The CSS is very basic, I'm about a quarter through the curriculum, but I wanted to upload this now to show progress.
